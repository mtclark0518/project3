# Color Psychology
Contributors:  Ian Nordeck, Connie Kephart, Tyler Clark, Jeff Reynolds

## Scope
## Why make this app?
To help people make color choices based on personality attributes, rather than on subjectivity.

### How is this app different?
Color selection is subject to taste or color theory, but there is no app on the market that bases color selection on the color psychology.

### What are we making?
Using the Dewey Color System, we are creating an app that proposes color palettes based on 32 different personality attributes. Conversely, we can identify personality traits to a user's existing color palette.

### Stretch Goals
* Render a complementary, monochromatic, analogous, triad, compound, or shades color palette based on the user's selected personality attribute(s).
* Color accessibility

## User Research
### Questions
1. A lot of logos utilize the color red. Why do you think that is?
  * Even more companies have blue logos. Do you suppose there's a reason companies choose the color blue? 
2. Do you think the color of a company's branding has an effect on its consumers?
3. If you were to start a company, what colors would you choose for your logo? Why?

4. If you were to start a company, what would you sell? 
	* If you could convey a feeling to the masses about your product and your company, what would you try to convey? 
	* From a mass communications standpoint, a lot of [marketing research](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3151897?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) has suggested that branding colors have a psychological effect on consumers viewing a brand. What would you want your branding to convey to potential customers?
